# Instructions for the oral presentation {#instructions-for-the-oral-presentation}

**CONTENTS OF THE ORAL PRESENTATION**

*   In Unit 4, 5, 6 or 7 (depending on the topic that you choose –drawing, painting, photography, sculpture or others) you will have to give an oral presentation **in class** about **your own artwork**, not about a famous piece in art history. You can talk about the techniques you use, the materials you employ, your source of inspiration, a software program you use... anything you can think of! You may bring your artwork to the classroom, you may demonstrate in real time how you carry out the creative process, or you may prepare some kind of visual aid (using Powerpoint, OpenOffice Impress, pdf, [Prezi](http://prezi.com/prezi-for-education/), etc.) with photos or videos showing your work.
*   It’s **individual** work, and the presentation should last for about **5 minutes**.
*   Remember **you cannot read** any kind of notes during the presentation.
*   If you use information from external sources (websites, encyclopedias, etc.), remember to quote those sources on the last slide of the presentation and/or in the glossary. It is better to use sources in English, instead of translating from sources that are in Spanish. Please **avoid using automatic translators** to translate Spanish text into English, since they don’t tend to yield good results.

**CHOOSING THE TOPIC**

*   You must **choose the area you’d like to work on by FRIDAY 13 OCTOBER (10 pm)**. To do so, click on the wiki “Signing up for the oral presentation”, which is placed in the initial block of the virtual classroom. Click on “edit”, write your name and topic in the appropriate slots and then click on “save”. Be careful not to delete any information accidentally. If you don’t choose the area of your presentation by that date, the teacher will understand that you don’t want to take part in the activity (you will therefore be excluded from continuous evaluation).

**MATERIALS THAT YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD TO THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM**

*   Once you have signed up for the oral presentation, you will be assigned to a group within the virtual classroom and will then see several assignments (the people in each group see their assignments only, with their corresponding deadlines).
*   As indicated in the virtual classroom assignments, around two weeks before your presentation you have to upload the following materials:

1.  If you decide to use a presentation and you want to use the teacher’s laptop, you have to **upload your visual aid** (Powerpoint, OpenOffice Impress, pdf, [Prezi](http://prezi.com/prezi-for-education/), video, etc) to the virtual classroom in the section corresponding to the unit you have chosen (unit 4, 5, 6 or 7). If you prepare an online Prezi presentation, upload a Word document with the URL of the presentation. When preparing the visual aid, make sure you follow the advice in [Some keys to a good oral presentation](http://prezi.com/u6wi2l4tlf6r/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy).
2.  A text document (Word or OpenOffice, no pdfs in this case, please) with a **glossary**, which should be uploaded by clicking on the link “Glossary for the oral presentation” in the corresponding unit. The glossary must include:
    *   *   Two words you have “recycled” from the vocabulary contained in the resources posted on the virtual classroom.
        *   One word that is NOT contained in the resources posted on the virtual classroom and that you think we should learn. The teacher will compile and publish a list with the words from the glossaries that you have to learn for the exam.
        *   You have the option (but not the obligation) of including up to 7 words that we don’t have to learn but that you consider necessary to understand the presentation.
    *   This is an example of what a glossary entry should look like:

**varnish:** a substance consisting of resin dissolved in a liquid, applied to wood to give a hard, clear, shiny surface when dry. Example: “I began the restoration of the painting by removing the upper layer of varnish”. _Spanish: barniz._ Source: WordReference.

1.  Once you know what people you will be presenting with on the same day, the whole subgroup (e.g. 3A, 3B, etc.) will have to prepare a **joint vocabulary activity integrating the three words chosen in each of the glossaries**. The activity must have a digital format (Word, PowerPoint, online flashcards, Kahoot, Socrative etc.) and should be designed as a class activity (rather than for individual independent study, though you should ideally provide the right answers, to help people revise the material later on). Be creative and find interesting formats! Upload the activityusing the link “Vocabulary activity on the glossary”. If your activity is hosted on the web, submit a text document with its URL.

If you click [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4atUfD146xBaUpUU3RQNzJGNG8&usp=sharing) you will access a folder with an example of glossary and an example of activity on the glossary (it is taken from a different course but it will serve its purpose as an example). Please bear in mind that the activity only refers to the words in one glossary.
